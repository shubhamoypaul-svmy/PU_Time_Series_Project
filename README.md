## Project Overview
This project focuses on backcasting past temperatures in Greenland using paleoclimate data from ice cores. The objective is to understand historical changes in temperature in Greenland and develop a model to backcast past temperatures. The project includes data collection, univariate and multivariate analysis, and model selection and fitting. The exploratory data analysis includes descriptive measures and line plots to identify trends and patterns. Univariate modeling techniques were initially used but did not provide satisfactory results. Therefore, multivariate analysis was conducted using variables such as CO2 concentration, volcanic eruption temperature, and ice surface temperature. Linear regression was used to analyze the data, and the results were compared to actual values to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The final model achieved an accuracy of 96%. The project faced challenges in acquiring sufficient and comparable data and in analyzing the data due to the lack of prior knowledge in paleoclimate analysis. The bibliography includes sources on time series modeling of paleoclimate data and software for paleoclimate research and education. The Github link to the source code is provided.
